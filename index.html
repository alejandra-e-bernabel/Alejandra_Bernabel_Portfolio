                <p>
                    My name is Alejandra Bernabel. I was born in Venezuela but have been living in Florida for the past thirteen years! I speak both Spanish and English fluently and continue to learn bits of Italian as a passtime.<br><br>
                    Because I love learning of all kinds, I double majored in Mathematics and English with a minor in Computer Science. After graduating in 2021, I went straight into teaching full time while attaining a master's degree in education. 
                    Although I loved teaching students to love learning as much as I did, I found myself looking for more intellectual challenges. It was then that I decided to dedicate myself to learning how to apply my knowledge of coding to endeavors such as game and website programming.<br><br>
                    Among my skills are C programming, C++ programming, C# programming, JavaScript, and HTML. I hope this portfolio gives some insight to my abilities and passions!
